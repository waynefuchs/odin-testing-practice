const caesarCipher = require('./caesar-cypher');

// a. Don’t forget to test wrapping from z to a.
// b. Don’t forget to test keeping the same case.
// c. Don’t forget to test punctuation!
// d. For this one, you may want to split the final function into a few
//    smaller functions. One concept of Testing is that you don’t need to
//    explicitly test every function you write… Just the public ones. So in
//    this case you only need tests for the final caesarCipher function. If
//    it works as expected you can rest assured that your smaller helper
//    functions are doing what they’re supposed to.
